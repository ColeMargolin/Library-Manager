# Library Manager

This is a full-stack library management system built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.
It allows users to manage books, authors, and genres with full CRUD functionality and includes a dynamic book report filtering page.

## Prerequisites

While Express and React are already a part of this repository, MongoDB will run locally and does not utilize a cloud service for this application.
Ensure that this service is locally downloaded and running manually before this web server will work. Node.js will also need to be manually installed,
and this should come with "npm" which will be important for starting the frontend and backend.

## How to run this Project

Clone the repository and cd into the Library-Manager folder. Make sure you have MongoDB running locally in the background. Now, run "npm install" in this directory
and "npm start" which should start running the server on port 5000. From here, cd into the frontend/ folder from the Library-Manager/ folder and run
the same commands "npm install" and "npm start". This should pull up the browser automatically on port 3000 for access to the website with the server running
in the background!
